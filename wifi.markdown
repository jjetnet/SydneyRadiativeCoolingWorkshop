The preferred option is through Eduroam, which is accessible throughout campus.

If you *can't access*  eduroam but need wifi, connect to the wifi network **UniSydney-Guest** and fill in the request form. In the sponsor field, enter boris.kuhlmey@sydney.edu.au. We will then approve as soon as practical, and you will have access for 24h. You may thus need to repeat this on the second day of the workshop.
